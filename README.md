## Focus

Module 8 focuses on an intorduction to time series data serving as an entry point for the concept of making predictions.
Most predictions involve using past data to infer something about the future and is rooted in the financial
sector. However, these prediction techniques and skills are relevant across a broad spectrum of industries,
from healthcare to retail and beyond.

Prophet is a modeling tool that provides a practical entry to using models to uncover relationships and make predictions.

Topics covered:

* Predictive modeling: Making specific, actionable predictions based on data.
* Plotting time series data: Generating data visualizations for easier reading and analysis.
* Analyzing results: Understanding and interpreting time series data, and incorporating an understanding of relationships between data points.

## Challenge

Analyze [Mercado Libre's](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-us/) financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow.

The Challenge has four steps:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.
* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.
* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.
* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.
